 # The Hangover

 A hilarious movie that always gets a laugh (ðŸ˜†) is "The Hangover" (2009). Itâ€™s a wild comedy about a group of friendsâ€”Phil, Stu, Alan, and Dougâ€”who head to Las Vegas for Dougâ€™s bachelor party. The morning after, they wake up to a trashed hotel suite with no memory of what happened the night before, and worse, the groom is missing!
